# Violence Detection System

Violence Detection System with Telegram Integration

Welcome to the Violence Detection System! This project is designed to identify and detect violent incidents from video footage using advanced machine learning techniques. Our model is trained to distinguish between violent and non-violent scenes with high accuracy, making it a valuable tool for enhancing security and monitoring safety.

üîç Features:

High Accuracy: Achieves a remarkable 95% accuracy in distinguishing between violent and non-violent scenes.
Real-time Detection: Processes images efficiently to detect violence in video feeds.
Telegram Bot Integration: Seamlessly integrated with a Telegram bot that alerts you with images containing detected violence.
üìà Technical Highlights:

Model Architecture: Utilizes a custom architecture with extensive training and optimization, including MobileNetV3 and data augmentation techniques.
Callbacks and Monitoring: Implements various callbacks for learning rate adjustments, early stopping, and checkpointing to ensure optimal performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides detailed metrics and visualizations, including confusion matrix and classification report, for comprehensive model evaluation.
